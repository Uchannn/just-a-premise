        <h1>Ⅰ. The Origin Story — “How I Got Here.”</h1>

        <p>I could start this journey out with something like, “I’m a creative, and I’ve always loved to draw.” But I don’t want to start that way. Instead, I’d like to tell you I didn’t choose to be a creator — it chose me.</p>

        <p>My first memory of ever doing something artistic was somewhere around primary school, when I’d gotten my hands on a paintbrush and watercolors. I should have known then I was in for a fucking ride; that little kid muttered to herself, “I’m never doing art again.”</p>

        <p>I truly thought that was the end of it, and maybe it could’ve been — if not for my mom. I was a picky child, and running out of shows to hold my attention, my mom found a little something called anime. Truthfully, I had already been watching anime like <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>, <em>Shaman King</em>, and <em>Inuyasha</em>, but I hadn’t known they were anime. If you ask me, my first true anime was <strong>Ranma ½</strong> — my first true love. I was engrossed.</p>

        <p>I didn’t just watch the anime either. No, I was one of those freaks that wanted to read manga <em>and</em> watch the anime. I was special, and Ranma was my everything. This was my true downfall! It didn’t just give me the urge to draw — it made me want to create stories.</p>

        <p>That’s what I did. I struggled and cried my way through learning hell. Of course, you’re never truly done learning, and I would never call myself a master, but I found myself enjoying the creations.</p>

        <p>Around college, I started to post my first Webtoon called <em>Yea It’s a Bit Small</em> (which is no longer up). While not my first comic, it was the series that allowed me to start. I didn’t stop there either — I made several comics. If you’re interested in my longest/oldest comic, I’d suggest checking out <a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/canvas/sumi-in-love/list?title_no=88837" target="_blank">Sumi In Love</a>. You can even watch an updated episode I did on YouTube below.</p>

        <h1>Ⅱ. The Now — “What I’m Doing With It.”</h1>

        <p>I took a long break from creating stories due to stress… and when that stress never left, I realized giving up on my love for creating stories was not the answer. I decided to create for myself again. I wasn’t drawing comics, just writing out my stories like I did as a kid — following my mom around stores, eyes glued to my iPod as I typed my little heart out.</p>

        <p>What I’m doing now is remembering what led me to start and quit. I’m in the process of reclaiming what was always mine: the love of creating. With that being said, I’ve realized a few important things about myself — I don’t like trying to “end” stories. I am a starter at heart. I thought the thing I was good at — the start — might be what others are struggling with.</p>

        <p>So I decided to build story starters that could help other creatives. That means I’m slowly working on narrative blueprints and kits. I’m a little slow because I love to jump around on projects, but as they grow, you’ll be able to find all the information about them here on my site.</p>

        <p>Check out my <a href="shop.html">shop</a> for all the current starters.<br>
        If you’re hoping for something more custom, check my <a href="https://ko-fi.com/dabblerwitch/commissions" target="_blank">services</a>.</p>

        <h1>Ⅲ. The Offer — “Where This Is Going (and Who I Want to Come With).”</h1>

        <p>You’ve made it to the end~! The people I’m most excited to help are other storytellers. I understand the stress of what it means to start — and now I know I can help people who are looking to begin with something more fleshed out. It doesn’t matter if you write novels, make games, or create comics — my starters are versatile!</p>

        <p>That being said, I’m a creative who takes her time with her work. I can’t rush through as others may be able to. So this is also an opportunity to adopt a witch! I’m open to creative sugar parents who wish to allow a little dabbler witch to focus on her craft instead of playing the “starving artist” game.</p>

        <p>So if you’re feeling like you’ve got sugar parent energy in you, hop over to my <a href="https://ko-fi.com/dabblerwitch" target="_blank">Ko-fi</a>! Monthly donations can support a creative like myself — and help me not fall over in a heap of exhaustion.</p>

        <p><strong>Either way, welcome to the coven.</strong></p>
